# requiredDuration in ticks
# it is recommended to add groups and signs using the in-game commands
# to avoid mistakes.
# Designed with signs in mind, but theoretically can be any block
# set in config.yml
#
# Example groups.yml
#rules:
#  requiredDuration: 5
#  onComplete:
#    - 'tellraw {player} {"text":"Thank you for reading the rules! \u2006\u2764","italic":true,"color":"yellow"}'
#  signs:
#    rules1:
#      world: world
#      x: -63
#      y: 114
#      z: 86
